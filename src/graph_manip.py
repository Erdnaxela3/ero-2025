    Notes:
        - If the input graph is not Eulerian (does not contain an Eulerian path), the graph is first
          modified using the `nx.eulerize` function.

        - The duplicated edge done by eulerize creates an additional edge with an empty dict as information.
          The edges in the modified graph are duplicated by copying their source for plotting purposes.
